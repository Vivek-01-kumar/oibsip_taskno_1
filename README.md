In this project, the focus was on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about retail sales. The dataset comprised 1,000 rows and 9 columns, including fields such as Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Amount.

Initially, the dataset was inspected for any null values, and it was found to be complete with no missing data. Following this, descriptive statistics were generated to understand the basic characteristics of the dataset, such as the mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical variables.

A time series analysis was conducted to observe sales trends over time. This analysis revealed that sales peaked in June 2023, marking the highest sales volume in the dataset. Further seasonal analysis, which examined average sales amounts by month, indicated that the second month of the year recorded the highest average sales.

The gender distribution analysis showed that females made up a larger portion of the customer base compared to males. Age distribution and product category preferences were also analyzed, revealing that clothing was the most preferred category, followed by electronics and beauty products. These insights were visually represented using bar plots.

Further analysis of the total amount spent in relation to the price per unit and quantity was carried out using box plots. This helped in identifying the distribution and variability of these financial metrics.

Lastly, a heat map was created to illustrate the relationship between gender and product categories. It showed that males had higher sales than females in the clothing and electronics categories, whereas females dominated the beauty category in terms of sales.

This comprehensive analysis provided valuable insights into sales trends, customer demographics, and product preferences, aiding the retail business in making informed decisions to enhance their sales strategy and target specific customer segments effectively.
